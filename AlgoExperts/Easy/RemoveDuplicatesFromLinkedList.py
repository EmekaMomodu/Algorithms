  You're given the head of a Singly Linked List whose nodes are in sorted order
  with respect to their values. Write a function that returns a modified version
  of the Linked List that doesn't contain any nodes with duplicate values. The
  Linked List should be modified in place (i.e., you shouldn't create a brand
  new list), and the modified Linked List should still have its nodes sorted
  with respect to their values.
