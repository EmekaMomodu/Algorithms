"""
Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.



Example 1:

Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
Example 2:

Input: nums = []
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: []

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 3000
-105 <= nums[i] <= 105

Approach 2: Hashset
Since triplets must sum up to the target value, we can try the hash table approach from the Two Sum solution. This approach won't work, however, if the sum is not necessarily equal to the target, like in 3Sum Smaller and 3Sum Closest.

We move our pivot element nums[i] and analyze elements to its right. We find all pairs whose sum is equal -nums[i] using the Two Sum: One-pass Hash Table approach, so that the sum of the pivot element (nums[i]) and the pair (-nums[i]) is equal to zero.

To do that, we process each element nums[j] to the right of the pivot, and check whether a complement -nums[i] - nums[j] is already in the hashset. If it is, we found a triplet. Then, we add nums[j] to the hashset, so it can be used as a complement from that point on.

Like in the approach above, we will also sort the array so we can skip repeated values. We provide a different way to avoid duplicates in the "No-Sort" approach below.

Algorithm

The main function is the same as in the Two Pointers approach above. Here, we use twoSum (instead of twoSumII), modified to produce triplets and skip repeating values.

For the main function:

Sort the input array nums.
Iterate through the array:
If the current value is greater than zero, break from the loop. Remaining values cannot sum to zero.
If the current value is the same as the one before, skip it.
Otherwise, call twoSum for the current position i.
For twoSum function:

For each index j > i in A:
Compute complement value as -nums[i] - nums[j].
If complement exists in hashset seen:
We found a triplet - add it to the result res.
Increment j while the next value is the same as before to avoid duplicates in the result.
Add nums[j] to hashset seen
Return the result res.

Time Complexity: \mathcal{O}(n^2)O(n 
2
 ). twoSum is \mathcal{O}(n)O(n), and we call it nn times.

Sorting the array takes \mathcal{O}(n\log{n})O(nlogn), so overall complexity is \mathcal{O}(n\log{n} + n^2)O(nlogn+n 
2
 ). This is asymptotically equivalent to \mathcal{O}(n^2)O(n 
2
 ).

Space Complexity: \mathcal{O}(n)O(n) for the hashset.

"""
Approach 3: "No-Sort"
What if you cannot modify the input array, and you want to avoid copying it due to memory constraints?

We can adapt the hashset approach above to work for an unsorted array. We can put a combination of three values into a hashset to avoid duplicates. Values in a combination should be ordered (e.g. ascending). Otherwise, we can have results with the same values in the different positions.

Algorithm

The algorithm is similar to the hashset approach above. We just need to add few optimizations so that it works efficiently for repeated values:

Use another hashset dups to skip duplicates in the outer loop.
Without this optimization, the submission will time out for the test case with 3,000 zeroes. This case is handled naturally when the array is sorted.
Instead of re-populating a hashset every time in the inner loop, we can use a hashmap and populate it once. Values in the hashmap will indicate whether we have encountered that element in the current iteration. When we process nums[j] in the inner loop, we set its hashmap value to i. This indicates that we can now use nums[j] as a complement for nums[i].
This is more like a trick to compensate for container overheads. The effect varies by language, e.g. for C++ it cuts the runtime in half. Without this trick the submission may time out.

Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: \mathcal{O}(n^2)O(n 
2
 ). We have outer and inner loops, each going through nn elements.

While the asymptotic complexity is the same, this algorithm is noticeably slower than the previous approach. Lookups in a hashset, though requiring a constant time, are expensive compared to the direct memory access.

Space Complexity: \mathcal{O}(n)O(n) for the hashset/hashmap.

For the purpose of complexity analysis, we ignore the memory required for the output. However, in this approach we also store output in the hashset for deduplication. In the worst case, there could be \mathcal{O}(n^2)O(n 
2
 ) triplets in the output, like for this example: [-k, -k + 1, ..., -1, 0, 1, ... k - 1, k]. Adding a new number to this sequence will produce n / 3 new triplets.
